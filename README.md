1. Write a Java program to solve the following problem:
You are tasked with creating a utility function for a text-processing application. The
function must generate all possible anagrams from a given group of distinct letters. For
example, the input {a, b, c} should return the output: abc, acb, bac, bca, cab, cba.
Additional Requirements:
1. The program should accept any group of distinct letters as input and produce the
correct result.
2. Optimize for readability and clarity.
3. Include basic validation (e.g., ensure the input is non-empty and contains only
letters).
4. Write unit tests to validate your function with at least three different test cases,
including edge cases (e.g., input with a single letter or empty input).
5. Document your code clearly, explaining the logic for generating anagrams.
